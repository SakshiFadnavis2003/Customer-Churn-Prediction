# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a fictional telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. Predicting customer churn can help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Collection and Understanding:**
   - Obtain the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its features and distributions.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize data distributions and correlations.
   - Identify key features that impact churn.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance model performance.

5. **Model Building:**
   - Implement various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
